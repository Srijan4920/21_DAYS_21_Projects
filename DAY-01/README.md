# Day 1: Data Storytelling - Analyzing Survival on the Titanic

## Project Overview

This project performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival. The analysis follows a complete data science workflow from data loading and cleaning to visualization and profiling.

## Objective

To perform a step-by-step exploratory data analysis that uncovers insights about survival patterns on the Titanic, serving as a complete guide covering data loading, cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, and visualization with theoretical explanations at each stage.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Titanic passenger dataset
- **Size**: 891 passengers with 12 features
- **Key Variables**: Passenger class, sex, age, fare, embarkation port, survival status

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
- Loaded Titanic dataset from CSV file
- Examined dataset structure, dimensions, and data types
- Identified missing values and data quality issues

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Treatment**:
  - Age: Filled missing values with median age
  - Embarked: Filled missing values with mode (most common port)
  - Cabin: Created binary feature 'Has_Cabin' due to high missing percentage (77%)
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created meaningful categorical variables
  - Extracted titles from passenger names
  - Binned continuous variables for better analysis

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Survival Analysis**: Overall survival rate of 38.4%
- **Demographic Analysis**: 
  - Gender impact on survival rates
  - Age distribution and survival patterns
  - Passenger class effects on survival
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified relationships between variables
- **Visualization**: Created comprehensive plots and charts

### 4. Data Profiling
- Generated comprehensive HTML profiling report using ydata-profiling
- Automated statistical analysis of all variables
- Interactive visualizations and correlation matrices
- Missing value patterns and data quality assessment

## Key Findings

- **Gender Effect**: Significant difference in survival rates between male and female passengers
- **Class Impact**: Higher passenger classes showed better survival rates
- **Age Patterns**: Certain age groups had different survival probabilities
- **Embarkation Port**: Passengers from different ports showed varying survival rates

## Technical Implementation

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **ydata-profiling**: Automated data profiling

### Environment Setup
- Resolved matplotlib compatibility issues with ydata-profiling
- Implemented error handling for robust execution
- Created fallback mechanisms for different environments
